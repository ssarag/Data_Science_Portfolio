							<h1>Superstore Sales Analisys using PowerBI</h1>
							
							<p>In this project, I used PowerBI to perform analysis on superstore sales data. The data for this dashboard was imported from superstore sales worksheet provided by PowerBI. It contains approximately 24 columns and a few lookup tables for returns and managers. Additional columns were added within Power Bi query editor to complete the data set.
                                <br></br>
                                                        </p>
						<h2>Data Cleaning and Transformation</h2>

                        <p>After importing the dataset, I used powerBI qurey editor to add addtional columns in the data. Some of the changes to transform the data are as below</p>
                        <p>1. The column "Sales" in the data contained the total amount of Sales but it did not mention the currency. To make the analysis easier I changed the values in the column to dollars.</p>
                        <p>2. Next, I created a new column "Year" in the dataset and used the powerBI query editor to extract year in which the sales took place. The year ranged from 2012 to 2015. This helped me to understand the year wise sales for better analysis.</p>
                        <p>3. Another column I created was "Delivery Days", which included the count of days in which the order was delivered.</p>

                              
                            <h2>Dashboard.</h2>
                            <p>The below image is the screenshot of the Dashboard that I created for analysis</p>
                            <span class="image">

                            </span>
